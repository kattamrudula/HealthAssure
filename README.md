# HealthAssure

In India, patient health records are not managed as a unified and connected asset/wallet, and this causes a lot of diagnosis and treatment issues.
The diagnosis and data is generally lost in paper records and hospital specific IP systems.
The current volume of these web2 records are in billions and managed by multiple disconnected  systems
This gives us a large opportunity to move these billions of records to a stable web3 chain

Our vision is to build a unified health information system leveraging Polygon blockchain transactions and Polygon NFTâ€™s for medical records.
This system will ensure a transparent and economically viable solution to maintain unified health records of patients and treatments.
A web front end will ensure all data is accessible across the globe in a decentralized format

We have built the platform leveraging GCP cloud and Polygon technologies with focus on high availability for 100+ million users
